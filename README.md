# CS50-Games-Track

I decided to do the games track.  (Of course I reserve the right to do some of the other tracks later as an excercise.)

For the Pong problem, to implement the AI, I created two new classes, and then modified the main.lua to use them.  As the base code is not mine to share, I have decided to not upload the entire working code here, but I will upload main.lua so that I can show my changes as a delta.
